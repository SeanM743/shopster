# Shopster Ecommerce Platform - Development Summary

## Project Overview
Shopster is a comprehensive full-stack ecommerce platform built with React TypeScript frontend, Spring Boot microservices, and MongoDB/Redis infrastructure. The platform features product browsing, authentication, premium membership (Shopster+), and shopping cart functionality.

## Architecture Summary

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18 + TypeScript** - Modern component-based UI
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling framework  
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing and navigation
- **React Query** - Server state management and caching
- **React Context** - Authentication and global state management

### Backend Services (Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.2.0)
1. **Product Service** (Port 8082) - Product catalog management with MongoDB
2. **User Service** (Port 8083) - Authentication and user management with PostgreSQL
3. **BFF Orchestration Service** (Port 8081) - Backend for frontend orchestration
4. **Membership Service** (Port 8084) - Shopster+ subscription management with PostgreSQL
5. **Cart Service** (Port 8085) - Shopping cart management with Redis

### Infrastructure
- **MongoDB** - Product data storage with flexible schema
- **PostgreSQL** - User and membership data with ACID compliance
- **Redis** - Session storage and cart management
- **Docker Compose** - Service orchestration and development environment

### Frontend Engineering
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, well-structured React components
- **State Management**: Proper separation of local component state and global auth state
- **Routing**: Comprehensive routing with protected routes and navigation
- **Form Handling**: Advanced form validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS

### Backend Engineering  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Well-defined service boundaries and responsibilities
- **Data Modeling**: Proper entity relationships and validation constraints
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer with Spring Data
- **Business Logic**: Service layer with transaction management
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive REST endpoints with proper HTTP status codes

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Git Repository Management**: Comprehensive version control with meaningful commit messages
- **Environment Configuration**: Dockerized services with environment-specific configs
- **Database Migrations**: Structured database schema management
- **Service Discovery**: Inter-service communication patterns

## Code Quality Standards

### Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both frontend and backend
- **Password Security**: Proper password hashing and validation requirements
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure token-based authentication with logout functionality
- **CORS Security**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for cart data, React Query for API caching
- **Database Indexing**: Proper database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Image Optimization**: Optimized image URLs with proper dimensions
- **Lazy Loading**: React component lazy loading for better initial load times

### Maintainability
- **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns and proper file structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and README files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Setup**: Test containers and testing infrastructure setup

## Session Updates - August 24, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes Completed

#### 1. Navigation Bar Authentication State Bug (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Login/signup buttons would display correctly on initial page load but disappear once products loaded, making it appear as if user was logged in when they weren't.

**Root Cause**: TestHomePage was using hardcoded header instead of the proper Header component with AuthContext integration.

**Solution**:
- Updated `apps/frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` with proper AuthContext integration
- Added dynamic UI rendering based on authentication state using `useAuth()` hook  
- Implemented proper logout functionality with navigation
- Fixed TestHomePage to use the integrated Header component

#### 2. Products Loading Failure (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Products section showed loading spinner for 15 seconds then displayed "Oops! Something went wrong" error with ERR_NETWORK/CORS failures.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was configured to call BFF service on port 8081, but only Product Service on port 8082 was running. Environment variable override was preventing code changes from taking effect.

**Solution**:
- Updated `apps/frontend/.env` file: Changed `REACT_APP_BFF_URL` from `http://localhost:8081` to `http://localhost:8082`
- Modified API service to call Product Service directly instead of through BFF orchestration
- Added comprehensive CORS configuration in `apps/product-service/src/main/java/com/shopster/product/config/WebConfig.java`
- Implemented extensive API debugging with axios interceptors
- Restarted frontend server to apply environment variable changes

#### 3. Development Debugging Infrastructure Added
**Enhancements**:
- Added request/response logging interceptors in `apps/frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- Created comprehensive CORS configuration for browser-backend communication
- Implemented detailed error logging for API failures
- Added MongoDB query logging capability in Product Service
