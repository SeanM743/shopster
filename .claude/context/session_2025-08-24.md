# Claude Code Session - August 24, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on familiarizing with the Shopster ecommerce platform and implementing key frontend features including product detail pages and authentication functionality.

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Application Exploration & Setup
- **Explored project structure**: Analyzed the microservices architecture with React frontend, Spring Boot services, and MongoDB/Redis infrastructure
- **Services status check**: Confirmed MongoDB and Redis were running, identified compilation issues with Java services
- **Frontend setup**: Successfully started the React development server on port 3000

### 2. Product Detail Page Implementation
- **Created ProductDetailPage component** (`/apps/frontend/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx`): Full-featured product page with image gallery, pricing, reviews, and buy box
- **Enhanced mock API** (`/apps/frontend/src/services/mockApi.ts`): Added `getProductById` method for product detail fetching
- **Added React Router setup** (`/apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`): Configured routing with BrowserRouter, added routes for home, product detail, login, signup
- **Updated ProductCard component** (`/apps/frontend/src/components/ProductCard.tsx`): Made cards clickable with navigation to product detail pages

### 3. Authentication System Implementation
- **Created LoginPage component** (`/apps/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`): Full login form with validation, password visibility toggle, and demo mode
- **Created SignUpPage component** (`/apps/frontend/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx`): Registration form with advanced validation and matching password checks
- **Implemented AuthContext** (`/apps/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`): React context for authentication state management
- **Updated homepage header** (`/apps/frontend/src/pages/TestHomePage.tsx`): Added login/logout functionality and user greeting

### 4. Backend Service Fixes
- **Resolved Java compilation issues**: Fixed Spring Boot version compatibility by downgrading from 3.3.0 to 2.7.18
- **Fixed validation imports**: Replaced `jakarta.validation.constraints.*` with `javax.validation.constraints.*` across all Java files
- **Successfully compiled product service**: Product service now compiles and runs with MongoDB connection
- **Service startup**: Product service started successfully on development profile

## Technical Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **New React components**: ProductDetailPage, LoginPage, SignUpPage
2. **Enhanced routing**: Added React Router DOM with protected routes capability
3. **Authentication**: Full auth context with localStorage persistence
4. **Navigation**: Clickable product cards with proper routing
5. **Mock API**: Extended with product detail fetching capability

### Backend Changes
1. **Spring Boot version**: Downgraded from 3.3.0 to 2.7.18 for compatibility
2. **Java validation**: Fixed validation annotation imports
3. **Maven configuration**: Simplified compiler configuration
4. **Service compilation**: Successfully compiling and running product service

### Configuration Files Updated
- `pom.xml` (product-service): Spring Boot version downgrade, validation import fixes
- `App.tsx`: Added routing and AuthProvider
- `package.json`: Already had react-router-dom dependency

## Files Created
- `/apps/frontend/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx` - Product detail page component
- `/apps/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Login page with form validation
- `/apps/frontend/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx` - Registration page with advanced validation
- `/apps/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication state management
- `/.claude/context/session_2025-08-24.md` - This session tracking file

## Files Modified
- `/apps/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added routing and auth provider
- `/apps/frontend/src/components/ProductCard.tsx` - Made clickable with navigation
- `/apps/frontend/src/pages/TestHomePage.tsx` - Added auth controls to header
- `/apps/frontend/src/services/mockApi.ts` - Added getProductById method
- `/apps/product-service/pom.xml` - Spring Boot version and configuration changes
- Multiple Java files in product-service - Fixed validation imports

## Current Application Status
- **Frontend**: Running on port 3000 with full navigation, product detail pages, and authentication UI
- **Product Service**: Compiled and running with MongoDB connection
- **Database**: MongoDB and Redis services operational
- **Authentication**: Demo authentication working with localStorage persistence

## Known Issues/Next Steps
1. **Backend services**: Need to start BFF orchestration service and connect frontend to real APIs
2. **User service**: Authentication should connect to actual user service endpoints
3. **Product data**: Currently using mock data, should connect to real product service
4. **Context organization**: Need to reorganize and clean up .claude/ directory structure

## Environment Details
- **Platform**: Linux WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- **Java**: OpenJDK 21 (downgraded Spring Boot for compatibility)
- **Maven**: 3.9.9
- **Node.js**: React development environment
- **Database**: MongoDB 7.0, Redis 7-alpine

This session successfully implemented the core frontend functionality requested by the user, including product detail pages, navigation, and authentication system.
