## Review Comments Framework

### Constructive Feedback Format
```markdown
## [SEVERITY] Issue Category: Brief Description

**Problem**: Clear explanation of the issue
**Impact**: Potential consequences or risks
**Solution**: Specific recommendations for improvement
**Example**: Code snippet showing recommended approach

**Priority**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Category**: [SECURITY/PERFORMANCE/MAINTAINABILITY/BUG]
```

### Example Review Comments

#### Security Issue
```markdown
## [HIGH] Security: Missing Input Validation

**Problem**: User input in `createUser()` method is not validated, allowing potential injection attacks.
**Impact**: SQL injection vulnerability could compromise database integrity.
**Solution**: Add @Valid annotation and implement DTO validation with Bean Validation constraints.

```java
@PostMapping("/users")
public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody CreateUserDto userDto) {
    // Validation will be enforced automatically
}
```

**Priority**: HIGH
**Category**: SECURITY
```

#### Performance Issue  
```markdown
## [MEDIUM] Performance: N+1 Query Problem

**Problem**: Loading user orders in loop causes N+1 database queries.
**Impact**: Poor performance with large datasets, potential timeout issues.
**Solution**: Use JOIN FETCH or @EntityGraph to load associated data in single query.

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.orders WHERE u.id = :userId")
User findUserWithOrders(@Param("userId") Long userId);
```

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Category**: PERFORMANCE
```
